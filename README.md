# Keras_Image_Classification_CNN
Convolution Neural Network Model For Binary Image Classification

Disclaimer: This code snippet is developed with an intension for generic use only. I hereby declare that the code was not part of any of my professional development work. Also, no sensitive or confidential data sources are used for this development.

Description: The repository consists of CNN deep learning algorithm for binary image classification problem:

Note:

1. User Input Section allows set all model parameters as well as data source specification. Users dont need to edit anything except this section. This is a fully automated end to end code
2. Folder structure should be mentained as Sample_Datasets folder uploaded here
3. Only train sample results will be reported
4. This script can only handle binary image classification however multiclass image classification can also be performed with minimal modification of the code

Compatibility: The code is developed and tested on Jupyter and Spyder Notebook using Python 3.7
